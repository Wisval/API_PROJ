##### Base idea
a ui that displays a card catologue, listed with YU-GI-OH cards with animations, basically an appealing App/website card selector/viewing.
though the base ideacan change as the App could also evolve as to showcase card interactions/combos as to display what a card can do in certain situatiosn when paired with another card etc. (though this would only be possible if I were to be knowledgeable enough of the rules, cards, metas etc.)



##### Secondary Idea (More plausible)
a questionare game that would list the name of a card, and the player would have to answer depending on the cards chosen attribute that needs to be answered (ie. if the card chosen was a Blue Eyes white dragon, the chosen attribute would be chosen randomly, such as atk, def, level etc. and you would have to answer the values of the chosen attribute (Attributes: cardtype, frametype, atk, def, archetype, race, level, attribute(element), linkval, scale etc.(effect is exluded due to the diffuculty of memorizing a whole effect of a card that indcludes specific words and sentences.))) though increased diffuculty could also be an option as the game could display the effect of the card, or two attributes with their values to guess the card itself(the name).
