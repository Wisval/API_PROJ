##### Base idea
a ui that displays a card catologue, listed with YU-GI-OH cards with animations, basically an appealing App/website card selector/viewing.
though the base ideacan change as the App could also evolve as to showcase card interactions/combos as to display what a card can do in certain situatiosn when paired with another card etc. (though this would only be possible if I were to be knowledgeable enough of the rules, cards, metas etc.)
